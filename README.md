### Who says !important is important?

**We all know `!important` sucks. Surprise yourself and see how much potential for useless quotes your stylesheets have!**

### Installation 😏

```
yarn add notimportant
```
or
```
npm i notimportant
```
### Usage 😏

To deal with all files in your `/src` folder in root directory run:
```
yarn notimportant
``` 
or 
```
npm run notimportant
```
  
If you want to specify another folder in your root directory, like `/styles`, add it after main command like this:  
```
yarn notimportant styles
``` 
or 
```
npm run notimportant styles
```

### Have fun! 🥴
